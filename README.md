# Rasmus Othar Kirketerp (CodeWizard)

Danish developer (born 1975) building practical, end-to-end systems with full-stack ownership.

## Core Identity

- System-builder mindset
- Focus on working solutions over theory
- Lightweight, cost-efficient architecture
- End-to-end delivery: frontend + backend + infra
- Values clarity, speed, and ownership

## Primary Tech Stack

- Languages: Python (primary), JavaScript, HTML/CSS, COBOL, C++, Pascal, Java
- Backend: Flask, SQLite, REST APIs, MQTT, Home Assistant integrations
- Infra/DevOps: Docker, Google Cloud Run, AWS (EC2/Lightsail/Route53/Terraform experiments), GitHub Pages
- Environment: Windows 11, VirtualBox (Home Assistant VM), DuckDNS, networking/port forwarding
- AI/ML: PyTorch (GPU), DQN, local LLM workflows (llama-server/Ollama), RSS AI summarization and scoring

## Hardware + IoT

- RTX 3070 Ti (CUDA 12.x)
- Zigbee2MQTT + Sonoff Zigbee dongle
- IoT sensors (energy, temperature, VOC)
- Solar panel + battery metrics
- Garmin watch integration experiments

## Major Projects

1. AI NewsReader (`othar.dk`)
   AI-powered RSS aggregation, translation, opinion-vs-fact separation, prioritization logic, optimized for speed and low cloud cost.  
   Live app: [`newsreader.othar.dk`](https://newsreader.othar.dk/) (Google AI Studio app).
2. Kenobi (Dog Walk Tracker)
   Home Assistant + MQTT + `input_datetime`, shareable web app (`othar.dk/kenobi`), intentionally minimal data model.
3. iPad Kitchen Dashboard
   Lightweight, performance-aware dashboard optimized for older iPad hardware.
4. DQN Car Simulation
   Deep Q-learning with replay memory, trajectory optimization, GPU training, later ported to Java for speed experiments.
5. Global Meta-DB Concept
   JSON-based lightweight shared data layer across micro apps with expiry metadata.

## Systems I Run

- Home Assistant (VM)
- Zigbee2MQTT
- MQTT broker
- Dockerized services
- Energy data ingestion pipelines
- Nilan gateway experiments
- Eufy security integrations
- Custom health-check endpoints

## Development Style

- Log-driven debugging
- Reproducible, copy/paste-ready workflows
- Speed + simplicity first
- Deliberate daemon/web separation
- Cost-aware cloud decisions
- Iterative building with practical AI integration
- Local models when possible (reduced SaaS dependency)

## Public Presence

- Domain: [`othar.dk`](https://othar.dk)
- GitHub: [@RasmusOtharKirketerp](https://github.com/RasmusOtharKirketerp)
- Public demos, AI media experiments, and structured agent prompting

## Unique Angle

Legacy enterprise background (COBOL/DB2 mindset) combined with modern Python/AI, IoT automation, GPU experimentation, and lightweight cloud infrastructure for real daily-use tools.

## Personal

Golden Retriever owner (Kenobi), long-term builder mindset, and interested in truth-focused AI prompting.
